            <p>ADOPTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES...</p>
    If you are interested in adopting a Doberman through the Doberman Rescue Alliance, please follow steps 1 & 2 below.
    We ask that you kindly read through our policies and procedures. We take rehoming these precious babies very seriously. We will not Ship pups. You must be prepared to drive to pick up your new baby once you have been approved. Or provide a fee for delivery <br>
    1. An Adoption Application Fee of 100 is required to be deposited. Our adoption coordinators are a team of Volunteers who devote their time to processing these applications. So the fee is given to them for their time dedication.They will perform home visits and check personal/Vet references to makes sure your home is suitable for a Doberman. Your Adoption Application processing fee con be paid through: Apple pay, zelle, chime, cash app, please note ADOPTION APP and please
    INCLUDE your email.<br><br>
    2. Once your application fee is received we will forward an application form to you but if the form has already been filled then the fee can be paid immediately after that or your document will not be checked upon submission. Please complete in full and email back to us so we can begin processing your application.
    Please fill out your application completely as we need to know as much about you as possible before we consider allowing you to adopt one of the adoptable Doberman . The information you provide will help us determine the best possible match for you, as well as for the dog. If you do not fill out the application in FULL, or are not 100% truthful, your application will be discarded without further notice. DO NOT LEAVE ANY UNANSWERED QUESTION or your application will not be processed. If the question does not apply to you, fill in the blank with "Not Applicable" or "N/A".
    Things to consider before applying:<br>
    <ol type="I">
    <li>Applicants must be between 18-25 years old or older.</li>
    <li>Most of our volunteers and foster families work full time, have families and have pets of their own, so please be patient.we will get back to you as soon as possible </li>
    <li>All dogs belong in the home for interaction as a family member. Do not apply to adopt one of our dogs if it will not live in your home with you as a family member, or other dogs that you currently have but are being kept outside.</li>
        <li>We do not tolerate chaining a dog outside.</li>
            <li>We require that all animals in the prospective adoptive family be spayed or neutered, up-to-date on rabies and distemper/ parvo vaccines, and heartworm tested and on prevention. We feel that "responsible" pet owners fit in this category.</li>
                <li>We prefer homes with fenced yards and fenced in pools.But we understand that each potential home is unique and we will take all of this into consideration when selecting the right"fit" for your home and your lifestyle.</li>
                    <li>We do not reserve dogs. Even if you seem like the perfect match for a particular dog, we will not hold a dog in a foster home to wait for you to get approved. It is not fair to the dog should another equally good match be approved and want to adopt. Similarly, we will not hold on to a dog for any length of time after you are approved. If a dog is to be kept for you then a fee is charged for their feeding depending on how long .</li>
                        <li>We recommend that you get approved before you see a dog you want so that when the right match comes along, you will be ready.</li>
                            <li>Keep in mind: Rescue dogs need and deserve your patience, whether it be house training, getting along with the other pets or just settling in. Be prepared as they will need time to transition and adjust to your home and family.</li>
